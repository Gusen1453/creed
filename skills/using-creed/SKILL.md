# Using Creed

> **Output language:** answer and write artifacts in the user's own language (match their messages, not the repo's history).

<SUBAGENT-STOP>
If you were dispatched as a subagent to execute a specific task, ignore this skill.
</SUBAGENT-STOP>

## When to use this skill

- Session start in a Creed workspace
- Unsure which Creed skill applies
- First use / companion skills may be missing
- Before creative, test, debug, or ship work — pick the right skill first

## Quick Start (install)

Companion skills are required — `using-creed` alone is not enough:

```bash
npx skills add Gusen1453/creed
```

## Detect install

Required skills: `explore`, `grill`, `write-spec`, `solid`, `write-plan`, `tdd`, `test-design`, `debug`, `review`, `commit-and-push`.

If any are missing from the workspace skill list: **stop and ask the user to run the install command above** before doing the work. Do not invent Creed workflows from memory.

## How to use

1. Match the task to a skill in the map below.
2. Announce `Using <skill> to …`, read that skill, follow it.
3. If it has a checklist, one todo per item.
4. When several apply, follow the default flow; between two work products run a **transition gate** (§ below) — never auto-advance into the next skill and never auto-review:

```
using-creed
  → explore? → grill → [gate] → write-spec → [gate] → solid? → [gate]
  → write-plan → [gate] → tdd (+ test-design)
  → [gate] → debug? → [gate] → review → [gate] → commit-and-push
```

`explore?` = Gate when the task modifies or references existing code (refactor / legacy / reuse); skip when greenfield.

`solid?` = Gate only when the slice adds modules / ports / IO edges; skip when no new boundary. Skipped → the `write-spec → solid` and `solid → write-plan` gates merge into one `write-spec → write-plan` gate (review object stays the spec; only the review-boundaries option drops).

`[gate]` = transition gate — one AskUserQuestion at each handoff; see **Transition gates**.

## Transition gates

Each producing skill ends with a **Transition gate** section of its own: one
**AskUserQuestion** at handoff — never auto-advance into the next skill, never
auto-review — with the same four-option shape (A) proceed / B) review first /
C) adjust / D) other), placeholders filled for that skill's object and review
rubric. So the gate travels with the skill and fires even when the skill is used
alone, bypassing this file. The skill's Hand-off is authoritative; this section
only documents the shape:

```
A) Recommended: Proceed → <next skill>
B) Review first — run **review** on the just-finished <object>
   (its rubric in the review skill's `references/`), then return to this gate and re-ask
C) Adjust — go back to <producing skill>, revise the <object>, then re-gate
D) Something else (I will type it)
```

Rules (identical in every skill's gate):

- **Choose B** → run **review** on that object with its rubric (it checks the
  object against its direct upstream; a claim→case table is mandatory). Fix Critical +
  Important findings, or have the user defer them with a reason. Then **return to
  the same gate** and re-ask — the user may pick A, request another review round,
  or adjust.
- **Choose C** → return to the producing skill, revise, then re-gate the object.
- **Skip only when** the user said "skip the gates this session" or explicitly
  waives a particular gate. The gate is one quick question, not ceremony —
  "too simple to ask" is the anti-pattern.

Two gates are custom: **grill → write-spec** has nothing to review yet (the spec
isn't written — no review option, only proceed/re-open); **review →
commit-and-push** guards the report verdict (proceed only when Critical/Important
are fixed or waived — never blind auto-ship).

Skipped `solid?` (no new boundary) → the `write-spec → solid` and `solid →
write-plan` gates merge into one `write-spec → write-plan` gate (review object
stays the spec; only the review-boundaries option drops).

## Skill map (scenarios)

| Situation | Skill |
|-----------|--------|
| Refactor / rework existing code — task names methods/classes/tables to change or reference | **explore** → grill → write-spec → … |
| New feature / behavior change / architecture / "grill me" / brainstorm — before any code | **grill** |
| Approved design → durable product spec (scenarios, scope, decision log) | **write-spec** |
| After spec: lock packages/ports/dependency arrows; or mock piles / coupling smell | **solid** |
| Approved spec (and solid if needed) → break multi-step work into TDD tasks | **write-plan** |
| Writing production code (feature / bugfix / refactor) | **tdd** |
| Writing or reviewing tests: worth testing? unit vs integration? what to assert / mock? | **test-design** |
| Bug, test/CI failure, unexpected behavior, or about to claim "fixed" | **debug** |
| Finished a task slice / before opening or updating a PR | **review** |
| Stage handoff — proceed vs review vs adjust (the user decides) | each skill's own **Transition gate** (in its Hand-off) |
| Review a spec / plan / structure decision as its own object (not code) | **review** (routes to `references/{spec,plan,solid}.md`) |
| User asks to commit / push / open a PR (PR needs a Test plan) | **commit-and-push** |

Common pairings:

- **explore → grill** — explore harvests repo facts (anchors, assertion checks, conflicts); grill then asks only the judgment calls.
- **grill → write-spec** — grill aligns decisions; write-spec locks what/why for mentoring and handoff.
- **write-spec vs write-plan** — spec = product scenarios & trade-offs; plan = files, order, RED→GREEN.
- **write-spec → solid? → write-plan** — solid is a Gate when boundaries are new; not a mandatory every-time step.
- **tdd + test-design** — tdd is the rhythm (test first, watch it fail); test-design decides what to feed, assert, and mock. Use both when implementing.
- **debug → tdd** — bug fixes: root cause with evidence first, then a failing regression test.
- **grill & solid** — during grill, only note boundary *smells* in options; do **not** switch the main skill to solid until what/why is locked.

## Minimal task prompt template (for the human)

Three blocks; the agent explores the rest and grills only what the repo can't answer:

```
Task: <one-line intent, name the method/class to change>
Hard constraints: <numbers, policies, red lines — only you know these>
Explore hints (optional): <class/method names to reference; the agent reads them itself — no need to describe>
Acceptance (optional): <one line of demo language: how we'll know it works>

Let the agent explore the repo for the rest; grill it only on judgment calls. Run /grill
```

Rules for the hard-constraints slot:

- Soft-constraint wording ("try not to" / preference style) = **priority, not a prohibition**. If it conflicts with repo reality (e.g., re-run idempotency), explore flags the conflict in the fact checklist and grill turns it into a trade-off question for you to decide.
- Don't write SQL, field names, method signatures, or assembly details — those are repo-answerable facts; writing them risks contradicting the code.

Example (before → after) — the same task: ~600 chars → ~150 chars. Everything cut was repo-answerable (SQL, field names, method signatures, assembly details); everything kept is human-only (concurrency, retry policy, red lines):

```
Before: 6-step flow + 3 SQL snippets + thread-pool/retry/Redis details + "the response format needs to be
List<ImageEmbeddingUpdateRequest.ContentItem> batchContentList" (a guess about the code)

After: Refactor RagRecoverPushJob#imageRecover to re-push dp_research_report_structure_info
(data_source in ('2','3'), id 111~2000) to the vector DB.
Hard constraints: descending pagination, 1000 per batch; 40-concurrency thread pool; on push failure retry
once, then enqueue to Redis for retry; try not to update dp_research_report_image_search.
Explore hints: SecAnnouncementThreadPoolManager, PushImageChunkService#buildReportChunkDto/#sendListToRag.
Let the agent explore the repo for the rest; grill it only on judgment calls. Run /grill
```
