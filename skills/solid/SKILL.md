# SOLID

## Overview

Apply **SOLID** so behavior is easy to change and to test without a pile of mocks.

**Companion skills:** shape the product with **grill**; prove behavior with **tdd** + **test-design**. This skill is only **structure and dependency direction**.

**Core principle: hard to test usually means hard to use — fix the boundaries, don't paper over them with mocks.**

## When to Use

- During **grill** design sections (architecture / components / interfaces)
- Before **tdd** when introducing new types, packages, or dependency edges
- Reviewing a PR that adds coupling or "needs 5 mocks to unit-test"
- Refactors aimed at testability

**When NOT to use:** pure glue scripts with no domain logic; drive-by renames; user explicitly asked for a throwaway spike.

## The Iron Law (non-negotiable)

```
1. New non-trivial behavior lives behind a boundary you can name (SRP).
2. Domain/policy does not depend on IO/framework details (DIP).
3. Fake abstractions invented only to satisfy a test are forbidden (no theater).
```

**Violating the letter is violating the spirit.** "Just mock the world" and "God class is fine for now" do not count.

## The five, as engineering checks

### S — Single Responsibility

- One unit → one reason to change
- If the name needs "and" / "manager of everything" → split
- Separate: orchestration vs policy vs IO vs formatting

### O — Open/Closed

- Prefer extending via new types/strategies/composition over editing a core switch forever
- YAGNI: don't pre-build plugin systems; do stop smearing new cases into a blob

### L — Liskov Substitution

- Subtypes must honor the caller's contract (pre/postconditions, errors)
- No "inherits for reuse" that surprises callers; prefer composition

### I — Interface Segregation

- Small, caller-shaped ports — not one mega-interface
- Callers shouldn't depend on methods they never use

### D — Dependency Inversion

- High-level policy depends on abstractions (ports), not on DB/HTTP/FS/SDK concretes
- Adapters at the edge; core stays pure/fakeable
- **Signal:** unit test needs ≥3 mocks → likely DIP/SRP failure (see test-design)

## Workflow (when invoked)

Announce "Using solid to …", then:

1. **Name the units** — what each does, how you use it, what it depends on
2. **Draw dependency arrows** — domain → ports ← adapters (never domain → SQL/HTTP client directly)
3. **SRP pass** — split "and" responsibilities
4. **ISP pass** — trim fat interfaces
5. **DIP pass** — push IO out; inject ports
6. **Theater check** — every new interface must have a *product* reason, not only a test reason
7. **Hand off** — resume **grill** approval or **tdd** with **test-design**

## Red Flags

- God class / package that "knows the whole feature"
- Domain imports ORM, HTTP client, or UI kit
- Subclass overrides that weaken invariants
- Interface with 15 methods for one caller that uses 2
- New interface used only in tests (no production adapter)
- Unit test mocks half the system to "isolate"

## Rationalization Table

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Split later when it hurts" | It already hurts when you need 4 mocks. |
| "Concrete is simpler than a port" | Until the second IO path. Port + one adapter is cheaper than rewrites. |
| "Inheritance reuses code" | Inheritance couples hierarchies; compose instead. |
| "One service interface keeps it tidy" | Fat interfaces force fake methods and ISP debt. |
| "Mocks prove DIP" | Mocks hide DIP failure. Fewer mocks after a real port is the proof. |

## Checklist

- [ ] Each unit has one clear purpose and a name without "and"
- [ ] Dependency arrows point inward to policy, not out to IO
- [ ] Ports are small; adapters own frameworks
- [ ] No test-only abstractions
- [ ] Ready for tdd/test-design without mock piles

## Hand-off

- Product decisions still open → **grill**
- Implementing → **tdd** + **test-design**
- Shipping → **commit-and-push**
